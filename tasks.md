  - [x] Implement Gemini 2.0-Flash OCR processing
  - [x] Create multi-page batch processing
  - [x] Handle layout challenges (multi-column, exercise numbering)
  - [x] Test on complex textbook layouts

### Phase 4: Model Comparison & Analysis
- [x] **Comprehensive OCR model testing**
  - [x] Test Gemini 2.5-Pro, 2.5-Flash, and 2.0-Flash on 5 pages
  - [x] Implement unified comparison framework
  - [x] Analyze accuracy vs speed trade-offs
  - [x] Document results: 2.5-Pro (74% accuracy, 47.7s) vs 2.5-Flash (63% accuracy, 13.6s)

- [x] **Quality gap analysis**
  - [x] Investigate 25% difference between Pro and Flash models
  - [x] Determine gap is mostly formatting, not content accuracy
  - [x] Conclude Flash model sufficient for production use

- [x] **Hybrid QA system evaluation**
  - [x] Test Flashâ†’Pro quality assurance approach
  - [x] Measure performance impact (6x slower processing)
  - [x] Conclude hybrid approach impractical for large documents

### Phase 5: Pipeline Optimization
- [x] **Intelligent OCR prompting**
  - [x] Design prompt to merge paragraph lines automatically
  - [x] Instruct model to skip page headers
  - [x] Preserve French formatting and textbook structure
  - [x] Test improved prompt: reduced paragraph merging from 220 to 29 instances

- [x] **Smart post-processing development**
  - [x] Create markdown post-processor for remaining fixes
  - [x] Implement intelligent paragraph merging (87% reduction)
  - [x] Add regex-based header removal
  - [x] Apply ruff-style auto-formatting
  - [x] Handle split formatting repair (bold/italic across lines)

### Phase 6: Production Testing & Documentation
- [x] **Unit 2 full processing test** (21 pages, pages 20-40)
  - [x] Baseline test: 81.6s processing, 220 paragraph merges needed
  - [x] Optimized test: 25.9s processing, 29 paragraph merges needed
  - [x] Document 90% reduction in manual editing work

- [x] **Project organization & documentation**
  - [x] Archive experimental files and old sessions
  - [x] Rename files with descriptive names
  - [x] Create comprehensive README with usage instructions
  - [x] Document performance metrics and pipeline details
  - [x] Move to dedicated repository
